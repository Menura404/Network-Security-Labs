# Network-Security-Labs 🔐
As part of my undergraduate studies in **Network Security**, I designed and implemented a secure virtual network infrastructure using **Kali Linux**. This project simulates a real-world security deployment, integrating multiple layers of protection, monitoring, and auditing techniques to defend against unauthorized access.

##🧩 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a hardened Linux environment featuring:

- **OpenSSH server** configured with **key-based authentication**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for added login security
- **Custom hardening measures** to reduce attack surfaces
- **Cowrie honeypot** deployment to track and analyze malicious activity
- **iptables firewall** to strictly filter traffic and log potential threats
- **Port scanning and vulnerability assessment** to detect and mitigate weaknesses

Although conducted in a simulated academic environment, the challenges and solutions mirror real-world scenarios faced by cybersecurity professionals.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔑 **Secure OpenSSH Configuration**  
  Hardened with key-based auth, disabled root login, custom ports, and protocol tuning.
- 🧠 **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  Added a second layer of defense using tools like Google Authenticator.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Honeypot with Cowrie**  
  Captured and analyzed brute-force login attempts and attacker behavior.
- 🔥 **Firewall Rules via iptables**  
  Crafted custom rulesets for ingress/egress filtering with robust logging.
- 🛡️ **Threat Detection & Logging**  
  Monitored SSH logs, honeypot logs, and firewall events to detect anomalies.
- 🧪 **Vulnerability Scanning**  
  Conducted port scans and baseline audits to uncover and fix security gaps.
